# Booklet Flow Data Science Project Template

[![<ORG_NAME>](https://circleci.com/github/itsderek23/cookiecutter-data-science.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/itsderek23/cookiecutter-data-science?branch=master)

This is a fork of the excellent [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science), focusing on creating a smooth CD4ML experience for data scientists.

## Requirements

 - Python 3.5 or greater
 - Git
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/itsderek23/cookiecutter-data-science


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:

```
